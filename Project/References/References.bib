  abstract = "This study aimed to answer the following questions (a) which of
              the soil variables (chemical, biological, enzyme activities and
              potential metabolic profile based on the Biolog method) could be
              used as indicators reflecting differences in soil quality between
              organically and conventionally managed asparagus fields, (b) how
              the duration of organic management affects these soil variables
              and (c) in what extent the soil quality in organic fields is
              comparable to that in hedgerows. The study included four
              organically cultivated fields which differed in the time they
              enter organic treatment: 6 years (O6), 5 years (O5), 3 years (O3)
              and 2 years (O2), the closest to them hedgerow (Ho), a
              conventionally managed field (CF) and its adjacent hedgerow (Hc).
              Among the chemical and biological variables, those contributing
              for most to the discrimination of the organic and conventional
              fields were mainly microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) and
              secondly variables related to N-cycle (NO3, N organic, rate of N
              mineralization). MBC and MBN were higher in organic and
              conventional areas, respectively, reflecting differences in the
              structure of their microbial communities. The chemical and
              biological variables did not differ among O3, O5 and O6 fields,
              while low values of organic N, rate of N mineralization and
              extractable P was recorded in O2 area. The enzyme activities of
              amidohydrolases (l-asparaginase,l-glutaminase, urease) and
              phosphatases (alkaline and acid phosphatase) were by far higher
              in organic areas than in the conventional one. The activities of
              amidohydrolases and alkaline phosphatase changed in a similar
              way, exhibiting higher values in O3 and O5 areas while between
              the oldest (O6) and the newest (O2) area no differences were
              recorded. While the suppress of enzyme activities in O2 was
              related to low inputs due to transition, the negative feedback
              between supply of N and P and activities in O6 was a possible
              explanation. The activity of acid phosphatase increased from the
              newest to oldest organic areas. The potential functional
              diversity and substrate evenness did not differ among sampling
              areas. Differences between areas were recorded only in relation
              to the carbohydrates' consumption. The soil quality of hedgerows
              seems to be completely different than that of the arable land in
              terms of all studied variables. Also, significant differences
              were recorded between the two hedgerows, a fact that could be
              related to the different management practices applied in the
              neighboring fields.",

  author    = "Silva, Marina and Prince, Mary Ellen",
  abstract  = "The aim of this study was to investigate the use of hedgerows by
               small mammals in four agricultural landscapes in Prince Edward
               Island, Canada. The Island has one of the highest percentages of
               land (about 48\%) devoted to crop production and pasture in all
               of Canada. Therefore, identifying the landscape elements that
               can mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation resulting from
               agricultural practices is essential to preserve the biodiversity
               of Prince Edward Island. We quantified species richness,
               abundance and diversity of small mammals in 13 hedgerows and 13
               attached forest patches. Although all the species detected in
               forest patches were also found in hedgerows, significant
               differences in species diversity and abundance suggest that not
               all species benefit equally from hedgerows. The abundance of
               small mammals other than the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus)
               increased in hedgerows longer than about 225--250 m, but was
               independent of hedgerow's length in hedgerows smaller than
               225--250 m. Predators (Mustela erminea) were captured in
               hedgerows, but not in forest patches. Relationships between
               small mammal variables and hedgerow features (microhabitat,
               macrohabitat and landscape) suggested that most small mammal
               species would benefit from hedgerows having high shrub
               diversity, ground cover with vines and leaf litter, and few
               non-vegetated gaps. Removal of hedgerows, especially large ones,
               may affect long-term survival of some small mammal species
               inhabiting agricultural landscapes of Prince Edward Island.",

  abstract = "Ecosystem management that attempts to maximize the production of
              one ecosystem service often results in substantial declines in
              the provision of other ecosystem services. For this reason,
              recent studies have called for increased attention to development
              of a theoretical understanding behind the relationships among
              ecosystem services. Here, we review the literature on ecosystem
              services and propose a typology of relationships between
              ecosystem services based on the role of drivers and the
              interactions between services. We use this typology to develop
              three propositions to help drive ecological science towards a
              better understanding of the relationships among multiple
              ecosystem services. Research which aims to understand the
              relationships among multiple ecosystem services and the
              mechanisms behind these relationships will improve our ability to
              sustainably manage landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem

              quality analyses, annual earthworm sampling and arbuscular

              functions between typical hedgerows, grass field margins, pasture
              and arable (mainly winter wheat) fields in a temperate, lowland
              setting. Mean bulk density (upper 50 cm), surface compaction and
              soil moisture content were significantly lower while organic
              matter content and porewater dissolved organic carbon
              concentrations were significantly greater in hedgerow soils, than
              margins or fields. Mean nitrate and phosphate concentrations were
              three and ten times larger, respectively, in soil solutions under
              hedgerows than arable fields while ammonium concentrations were
              least in arable fields. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was
              significantly greater under hedgerows (median = 102 mm hr???1)
              where it took an average of one hour longer for soils to reach
              maximum moisture content following rainfall, than adjacent arable
              (median = 3 mm hr???1) or pasture fields and margins (median = 27
              mm hr???1). Hedgerow soils had a greater proportion of flow through
              micropores and less macropore flow than other soils. The pasture
              and margin soils had the largest proportion of macropore flow
              (>85\%) and more (and larger) anecic earthworm species, such as
              Lumbricus terrestris which produce vertical burrows. Earthworm
              density, biomass and diversity were greater in pasture and margin
              soils, followed by hedgerow soils, and tended to be lowest in
              arable soils. For both total and AM fungi, hedgerow soils hosted
              a distinct and heterogeneous soil community, margin and pasture
              communities were diverse but clustered together, and arable
              communities formed a distinct cluster, with low inter-sample
              variation and significantly lowest AM fungal richness. The
              findings demonstrate that soils under hedgerows, which should be
              conserved, can provide important functions on farmland including
              storing organic carbon, promoting infiltration and storing
              runoff, increasing earthworm diversity and hosting distinct AM
              communities.",
